# NYC-Taxi-Data-Analysis

Using NYC Taxi data available on the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission website, we intend to analyze the geography of pickup and drop-offs made by the cabs during peak hours of the day. The data set includes 11.2 million trips made during the month of June 2016 and drills down each trip to particulars like pickup and drop-off dates, time, longitude, latitude, trip distance, fare amount, etc. We aim to identify the area that is the busiest during the peak hours and target the average commute time during weekdays and weekends. This would give us a sense of how much time it takes for a person to get from Point A to Point B with and without traffic (assuming weekends have little or no traffic as compared to weekdays).
